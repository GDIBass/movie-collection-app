# Developer Test
This test is comprised of 5 development related questions and a small code test. For the questions please add as much explanation to your answer as you feel is appropriate.

# Questions
## Write a function that checks if an inputted value is a palindrome. The function should return true/false (bool). You can assume that all input will be a string type and lower case.

## Write a function that checks if an inputted value is a numerical range "100-200". Inputted values can be an integer or a string in the previously stated format. The return should be a true/false (bool) value. Ranges should also allow floats (e.g. "100.00"). The range should also be listed as min/max order. Valid values: 100-200, 100.0-200.1. Invalid Values: 100, 200-100.

## What is the difference between a queue and a stack?

## In an array with integers between 1 and 1,000,000 one value is in the array twice. How do you determine which one?

# Build a movie collection app
We need to prototype an application which makes use of The Movie DB's API. You do not need to build out an entire registration/login feature, the information saved to the database can be a predefined user.

You can use any libraries, frameworks, languages, and technologies that are freely available. Use your best judgement keeping in mind that other Developers may be expanding on your code.

If you have any questions feel free to contact us.

Requirements
When you have completed and submitted your code it should meet the following requirements.

Have proper setup guide so that another developer can follow and run the app in their local environment.
Successfully retrieve movie information from the movie database API.
User can mark/unmark that they own the movie that was searched for.
The search result page should display: movie title, release date, and overview. This should be for all movies found in a list, but you only need to display the first 10 results at most.
The bottom of the page should return the total number of search results. However, you do not need to paginate the results - displaying only 10 results will be fine.
Submitting your completed tasks.
Once you have completed all the tasks please send the email your answers to the 2 questions directly to xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.com.

For the application please upload the link to your code on github and email the link to xxxx xxxxx.
